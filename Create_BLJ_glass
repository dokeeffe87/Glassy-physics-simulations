# Create a 2D binary Lennard-Jones glass at constant pressure to be used in an oscillation experiment later.
# We will compute the average volume at the desired pressure and use that to fix the volume of the deformed samples
# We also want to see if this is a good glassy state, so look at volume as a function of temperature
# Mean squared displacement and heat capacity at constant pressure
